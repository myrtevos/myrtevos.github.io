I'm working on a PhD in experimental semantics at the University of Troms√∏, where my supervisor is [Gillian Ramchand](https://gillianramchand.blog/){:target="_blank"} I use eye-tracking (mostly via webcam) to investigate how people process subtly different types of verb tense and aspect (mostly in English). 
As a side-effect, I am now also really interested in web-based research, from design and programming to privacy and ethics.

In my downtime, I skate with [Arctic Roller Derby](https://www.instagram.com/arcticrollerderby/){:target="_blank"} and make things (mostly with yarn and art supplies).
