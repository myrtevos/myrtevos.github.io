description: pictures I've drawn for experiments

To run behavioural experiments you need stimuli: pictures or sounds or other things for your participant to experience. Stimuli need to be very carefully designed and created in order for them to elicit the right response. For my PhD project I use a set of images created by a professional illustrator, but I have created stimuli for other projects, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/myrtevos/stimuli){:target="_blank"}. These were all hand-drawn with paper, pencil, and black marker, then scanned to be smoothed, edited, and colored in using Pixelmator.
