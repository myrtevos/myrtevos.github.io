In spring 2020, a lot of my colleagues (and myself!) doing behavioural research with humans were faced with an indefinite halt to our work. We couldn't travel or invite participants to the lab to take part in our experiments, so we had to transition to collecting our data online. Because I was already working with the IT department at UiT to set up a [JATOS server](https://www.jatos.org){:target="_blank"}, which would allow us to collect data without a third-party data processor (and attendant complications with Norwegian data privacy regulations), I got the opportunity to work as a web-based research assistant for [AcqVA](https://site.uit.no/acqva/){:target="_blank"} and [CASTLFish](https://site.uit.no/castlfish/){:target="_blank"}, to advise and help people set up their web-based research.

During that year, I gave a few talks and Zoom tutorials; worked with MA students to operationalize their thesis data collection; developed custom [jsPsych](https://jspsych.org){:target="_blank"} experiments for fellow researchers; and wrote a [JATOS for beginners](/assets/JATOS_for_UiT.pdf){:target="_blank"} handbook. It was great to be able to learn so many new skills and build connections with other researchers during a time when we were all isolated.
