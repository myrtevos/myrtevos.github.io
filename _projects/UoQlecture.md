On July 15, 2021, I presented a webinar 'at' the University of Queensland for the opening webinar series of their [Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html){:target="_blank"} (which I highly recommend as a learning resource for anyone working with language data of any kind!). I gave a practical demonstration of how you can use open source software libraries (jsPsych and JATOS) to write, host, and run a behavioural experiment over the internet (even with modest programming abilities!) by speedrunning through the process: from the empty code editor to sending out links to participants. I also saw an opportunity to shoehorn half a dozen pictures of my cat into it. Thanks for having me, LADAL!
